# Sparse Models

- **Inverted Index:** Codes of constructing inverted index for each dataset are in [./indexing](https://github.com/nju-websoft/ACORDAR-2/tree/main/Code/sparse/indexing).

- **Sparse Retrieval Models:** Codes of implementing four sparse retrieval models (*TF-IDF*, *BM25*, *LMD*, *FSDM*) are in [./models](https://github.com/nju-websoft/ACORDAR-2/tree/main/Code/sparse/models).

- **Field Weights Tuning:** Codes of tuning field weights are in [./fieldWeightsTuing](https://github.com/nju-websoft/ACORDAR-2/tree/main/Code/sparse/fieldWeightsTuning).

- **Retrieval Experiments:** Codes of retrieval experiments on our test collection are in [./experiment](https://github.com/nju-websoft/ACORDAR-2/tree/main/Code/sparse/experiment).

- **Field Weights for Pooling:** Field weights for pooling are in [https://github.com/nju-websoft/ACORDAR-2/edit/main/Code/sparse/pooling field weight.txt], splitted by tab.
