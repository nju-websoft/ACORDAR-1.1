# ColBERT

We reuse the implementation of [Omar et al., 2020](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT).

First follow `Code/src/preprocess/README.md` in our repo to generate pseudo documents for indexing.

```
git clone https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT.git
```

Then specify the path of our pseudo documents in their command.

Then follow the instructions of their repo to index and retrieve.
