# ColBERT

We reuse the implementation of [Omar et al., 2020](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) by changing their preprocessing script to fit our dataset. 

```
git clone https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT
```

Then specify the path of our document file in their command.

Then follow the remaining instructions of their repo.
